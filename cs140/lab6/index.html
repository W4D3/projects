You are in Vegas with your wife and her family.  On morning number 1, they all
want to go to the "Venetian" hotel and casino to ride the Gondolas.  You have
the choice of going or staying.  Hmmm, let's see.  You've already overpaid once
in your life to ride a real gondola in Venice.  It's something like 500 bazillion
degrees in Vegas, and the gondola rides are in a big concrete 
swimming pool.  You thank the family, but send them on their merry way.
<p>
You wander around the casino, and see this game called <i>Keno</i>.  It's a
bit like a lottery.  There are 80 balls numbered 1 through 80, and they will
pick 20 of them randomly.  They have a catchy little flier about all the 
Keno bets you can make:
<p>
<table border=3>
<td valign=top> <IMG src=K1.jpg width=350></td>
<td valign=top> <IMG src=K2.jpg width=200><br>
                <IMG src=K3.jpg width=200></td>
<td valign=top> <IMG src=K4.jpg width=200></td>
</table>
<p>
The whole flier is <a href=Keno.jpg>here</a>.
<p>
Now, we're talking entertainment!  You know there's no way that these
tempting little bets are going to make you money in the long run, but
have a little mathematical problem to solve, and that's better
than gambling!
Your job is to figure out which of these bets is the best -- in other words,
which one will lose you the least amount of money in the long run.
<p>
Let's analyze the bet sheet.  On the "2-Bit Menu" you will pay a quarter per
game, which you will not get back.  Let's say you choose the "5 catch win."  This
means that you will pick five numbers.  They will pick 20.  If exactly three
of your five numbers are in their twenty, they pay you a quarter (i.e. you
get your money back).  If exactly four of your five are in their twenty, 
then they pay you a dollar.  And if all five are your numbers are in their
twenty, you win $200!!!!!  Whoo-hoo!!!
<p>
So, suppose you want to calculate what the average return on your investment 
will be.  The probability of matching exactly three balls is 0.0839351.  
The probability of matching exactly four balls is 0.0120923.
And the probability of matching exactly five is 0.000644925.
I'll show you how to calculate those later.  So, to calculate your return:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> You always lose your initial 0.25
<LI> 8.39351 percent of the time, you win back 0.25.  
<LI> 1.20923 percent of the time, you win back a dollar
<LI> 0.0644925 percent of the time, you win $200.
<LI> Therefore, your return is -0.25 + 0.0839351 * (0.25) + 0.0120923 * (1) 
+ 0.000644925 * (200).  That is -0.087939, so you lose roughly nine cents 
on every 25 cent bet.
<LI> If you care to normalize that to the dollar, you normalized return is 
-0.087939/.25 = -0.35 per bet.  That's one lousy bet.  At least it only 
costs a quarter (although the fine print says you have to play 21 times....)
</UL>

<hr>
Onto the lab.  In mathematics, a binomial coefficient <i>binom(n,k)</i> is
defined to equal (n!)/((k!)(n-k)!).  It represents the number of ways to choose
<i>k</i> distinct items from a collection of <i>n</i>.  Therefore, the total
number of ways that you can choose 20 balls from 80 is  <i>binom(80,20) = (80!)/(20!60!)</i>.
<p>
In Keno, suppose you pick <i>p</i> balls.  Then the number of ways to match
exactly <i>c</i> of those <i>p</i> in the twenty randomly chosen balls is:
<p>
<center>
<i>binom(80-p,20-c) * binom(p,c)</i>
</center>
<p>
So, the probability of you matching exactly exactly <i>c</i> of <i>p</i> is:
<p>
<center>
<i>binom(80-p,20-c) * binom(p,c) / binom(80,20)</i>
</center>
<p>

Let's take a concrete example.  If we choose five balls and want to match exactly
three, that's: <i>binom(75,17) * binom(5,3) / binom(80,20)</i>.  Which equals:
<p>
<center><img src=binom1.jpg height=50></center><p>
Fortunately, we can cancel quite a few of these terms.  For example, 
(75!)/(80!) = 1/(80*79*78*77*76).  And 
(5!)/(3!) = 5*4.  
We can keep cancelling until we get:
<p><center><img src=binom2.jpg height=50></center><p>
This equals 0.0839351. 
<p>
(For the true nerds, yes, we can do a prime factorization and cancel many more terms,
but for the purposes of this lab, we'll just do simple cancellations).

<h3>Your Job: #1: product.cpp</h3>

You are to write two programs: <b>product.cpp</b> and <b>keno.cpp</b>.
<p>
The first implements a class called a "product", defined
in
<b><a href=product.h>product.h</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#ifndef _PRODUCT_H
#define _PRODUCT_H
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
using namespace std;

class Product {
  public:
    void Invert();
    void Multiply_Number(int n);
    void Divide_Number(int n);
    void Multiply_Factorial(int n);
    void Divide_Factorial(int n);
    void Multiply_Binom(int n, int k);
    void Divide_Binom(int n, int k);
    void Clear();
    void Print();
    double Calculate_Product();
  protected:
    vector &lt;int&gt; numerator;
    vector &lt;int&gt; denominator;
};

#endif
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This represents a product as two vectors - a numerator and a denominator.
These will start as empty vectors.
When you call <b>Multiply_Number(i)</b>, you will make sure that <b>numerator[i]</b> and
<b>denominator[i]</b> exist, and then you will increment 
<b>numerator[i]</b>.  
When you call <b>Divide_Number(i)</b>, you will again make sure that <b>numerator[i]</b> and
<b>denominator[i]</b> exist, and then you will increment 
<b>denominator[i]</b>.   You don't have to error check, but you may assume that 
<b>Multiply_Number(i)</b> and
<b>Divide_Number(i)</b> are always called on positive integers.

So, if you make the following calls:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
Product p;

p.Multiply_Number(4);
p.Multiply_Number(5);
p.Multiply_Number(5);
p.Divide_Number(5);
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Then <b>p's</b> numerator will be a vector containing: { 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2 } and 
<b>p's</b> denominator will be a vector containing: { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 }.
<p>
The other calls are defined as follows: 
<p>
<UL>
<LI> <b>Multiply_Factorial(n)</b> and <b>Divide_Factorial(n)</b> multiply and
divide by <b>(n!)</b>.  Note, (0!) is equal to one and negative numbers are undefined.
You do not have to error check for negative numbers.
<p>
<LI> <b>Multiply_Binom(n,k)</b> and <b>Divide_Binom(n,k)</b> multiply and
divide by <i>binom(n,k)</i>.  Again, you do not have to error check for negative numbers,
or for whether <b>k</b> is greater than <b>n</b>.  However, it's fair game for <b>k</b> 
to be zero, and for both 
<b>n</b>  and <b>k</b>  to be zero.
<p>
<LI> <b>Invert()</b> swaps the numerator and denominator.
<p>
<LI> <b>Print()</b> prints what the product is by printing the numerator and denominator.  It should
cancel numbers that are in both the numerator and denominator.  Numbers in the numerator should
be separated by spaces and asterisks, and numbers in the denominator should be separated by 
slashes.  If the numerator is equal to one, print "1".  If the denominator is equal to one, print 
nothing.  
<p>
For example, the following code:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
Product p;

p.Multiply_Number(5);
p.Multiply_Number(4);
p.Divide_Number(3);
p.Print();
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Will print:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
4 * 5 / 3
</pre></td></table></center><p>

And the following code:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
Product p;

p.Print();
p.Multiply_Binom(6,3);
p.Print();
p.Multiply_Number(5);
p.Divide_Number(4);
</pre></td></table></center><p>
Will print:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>

1
4 * 5 * 6 / 2 / 3
5 * 5 * 6 / 2 / 3
</pre></td></table></center><p>
<LI> Finally, <b>Calculate_Product()</b> calculates and returns the product.
Like <b>Print()</b> if terms cancel, 
<b>Calculate_Product()</b> should not use them for the calculation.  For example, in the
last product above, 
<b>Calculate_Product()</b> should calculate 5*5*6/2/3, and not 4*5*5*6/2/3/4.
</UL>

Although that's a lot of text, implementing <b>product.cpp</b> is extremely 
straightforward.  It shouldn't take you long, but make sure you test it.
<p>
To help you test, I have a program called
<b><a href=prod_tester.cpp>prod_tester.cpp</a></b> in the lab directory, which 
lets you enter commands on standard input to manipulate a product:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>prod_tester</b>
<b>Help?</b>
Bad command.  Should be one of

  CLEAR, CALCULATE, INVERT, PRINT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, MULT_EXP, DIV_EXP, MULT_BINOM or DIV_BINOM.
<b>PRINT</b>
1
<b>MULTIPLY 5</b>
<b>PRINT</b>
5
<b>DIVIDE 5</b>
<b>PRINT</b>
1
<b>MULT_BINOM 75 17    </b>
<b>MULT_BINOM 5 3</b>
<b>DIV_BINOM 80 20</b>
<b>PRINT</b>
4 * 5 * 18 * 19 * 20 * 59 * 60 / 2 / 76 / 77 / 78 / 79 / 80
<b>CALCULATE</b>
0.0839351
<b>&lt;CNTL-D></b>
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

When you compile your <b>product.cpp</b> with 
<b><a href=prod_tester.cpp>prod_tester.cpp</a></b>, your output should match mine
<i>exactly</i>.  Many of the grading script's tests will use <b>prod_tester</b> 
to test your program.  

<hr>
<h3>Your Job: #2: keno.cpp</h3>

Now that you've written <b>product.cpp</b>, use it to write <b>keno.cpp</b>,
which calculates Keno odds using the formula above.  <b>Keno.cpp</b> should
read numbers on standard input.  The first word will be the amount to bet, 
and the second should be the number of balls that you are going to pick.
After that, there will be pairs of words that compose the winning table.
These will be in the order <i>catch, payout</i>, where <b>catch</b> is the
exact number of balls to match, and <b>payout</b> is the payout of that 
number of balls.  You do not need to error check.
<p>
So, for example, the "5 catch win" above would be represented with:
<pre>
0.25 5    3 0.25   4 1   5 200
</pre>

Now the first line of your program should print out the bet, and the second
line should print the balls picked.  The bet should be padded to two
decimal places (use <b>printf</b> instead of <b>cout</b>).  Then for each 
payout, you should print the probability of winning and the expected 
return (probability times payout).  Use <b>cout</b> for these lines
and have them match mine exactly.  Finally, you should print the 
expected return per bet, which is the sum of all expected returns minus
the bet.  Have this padded to two decimal places (use <b>printf</b> instead of <b>cout</b>).  
Finally, print the normalized return, which is the expected return divided by the
bet.  Again, pad that to two decimal places.  
<p>
This lets us evaluate all the Keno options in the flier.  First, the "2-bit menu":

Clearly, the "2-bit" menu is not a sound investment strategy.  I especially love

<h3>This is no longer required -- I just include it for amusement</h3>

You are visiting your aunt and uncle, and as you walk by their 
computer room, you hear your eight-year-old neice Pippy swearing
up a storm in front of her computer.  As you probe, you realize
that she's blowing a simulated wad of money on
<a href=http://onlinekeno.net/play-free-keno/online-keno>Free Online Keno</a>!!!
<p>
Using your newfound understanding of Keno and your ability to 
program, write up a paragraph that shows Pippy how much she is losing
on each of her fifteen potential Keno bets.  

<p>

<hr>
<h3>Doing Keno in Stages</h3>

<b>Keno.cpp</b> is a very small program (mine is 56 lines), but you can still
do it in stages.  For example, I did it in three stages.  Stage 1 just prints
out the input:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>echo "0.25 5    3 0.25   4 1   5 200" | keno1</b>
Bet: 0.25
Balls Picked: 5
  Catch 3/5 - 0.25
  Catch 4/5 - 1.00
  Catch 5/5 - 200.00
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

Stage 2 calculates the probabilities.

<pre>
UNIX> <b>echo "0.25 5    3 0.25   4 1   5 200" | keno2</b>
Bet: 0.25
Balls Picked: 5
  Probability of catching 3 of 5: 0.0839351
  Probability of catching 4 of 5: 0.0120923
  Probability of catching 5 of 5: 0.000644925
UNIX>
</pre>

And then stage three finishes everything up.
