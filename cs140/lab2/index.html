<h2>Executables</h2>
<p>
As always, there are executables for each part of the lab in the lab
directory.  Make sure you test them out and make sure that your answer
matches them <i>exactly</i>.  If you have simple questions about what
your program should do, try checking the executable first rather than
asking the TA.  Often, the answer is there.

<h2>PGM Files</h2>

This lab lets you create and manipulate PGM files.  
PGM stands for <i>portable gray-map</i>, and is file format for 
non-color digital pictures.  PFG files are nice because they
are ASCII files that you can view with an editor like <b>vi</b> or
<b>emacs</b>, and that you can also view with certain software.
<p>
Unfortunately, most web browsers do not have support for PGM files.
However, every environment has many ways of dealing with them.
For example, Photoshop and Open Office both support them as image
types.  I would guess that iphoto and whatever photo editor
comes with Windows handles them as well.  
<p>
Most Unix environments have a program called <b>convert</b>, which
will convert pgm's to jpgs for easy viewing.  For example, on 
our labs:
<p>
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cp /home/plank/cs140/Labs/Lab2/Nigel.pgm .</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>convert Nigel.pgm Nigel.jpg</b></font>
</pre>
You may now view <b>Nigel.jpg</b> with a web browser.  Test it out.
It should look like:
<p>
<center>
<img src=Nigel.jpg>
</center>
<p>

Here are a bunch of sample PGM files that you can use with this lab.
They contain some of my most important role models.
Unfortunately, you shouldn't try to create your own PGM files with the above
software, as most PGM converters convert to a different format, or they include
comments, which I'm not requiring you to handle in this lab.
<p>
Also, the sizes of the JPG pictures below do not match the PGM files.  I've shrunk
some of them to make them display better.

A picture is simply a two-dimensional array of <i>pixels</i>.  In
a PGM file, a pixel is a gray value between 0 and 255.  Zero
is black, and 255 is white.  Everything in between is a different
shade of gray.
<p>
PGM files have a specific format.  (Actually, they are more
robust than this -- I've removed comments to make them easier for
you).  A PGM file is composed of
words.  The first word is ``<b>P2</b>''.  Then the next two words
define the number of pixels in the picture -- first is the number of
columns in the two-dimensional array, and then the number of rows.
The next word is the number 255.  So, if you look at the beginning of
<b>Red.pgm</b>, you'll see:
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>head Red.pgm</b></font>
P2
235 183
255
 67  74  76  80  76  77  70  67  75  82 102 119 129 133 130 127 128 
130 134 131 130 129 130 133 132 125 116 109 101 102 105 105 113 119 
128 133 138 137 137 137 141 143 143 144 140 143 146 144 140 138 128 
122 118 107 106 104 106 107 115 124 127 121 114 108 103  98  97 108 
122 138 140 140 139 129 123 125 127 141 145 147 147 146 147 147 147 
149 150 150 150 155 168 185 195 198 202 201 201 200 200 199 201 199 
200 201 207 205 206 203 204 205 206 206 205 206 207 207 207 207 207 
UNIX>
</pre>
This means that <b>Red.pgm</b> is a 183 * 235 array of pixels.  After
the 255 come all the pixels.  First, the pixels in the top row, then
the pixels in the next row, etc.  Note that the ASCII formatting of
the file doesn't mean anything -- there could be one pixel per line
and the file would still be a legal PGM file.  In <b>Red.pgm</b>
above, the first 235 pixels are those in the top row, then the next
235 are in the second row, and so on.  There will be a total of
183*235 = 43005 pixels.  After the last pixel, the file ends.
<p>
Before you go any further, create a PGM file of your own -- make
it 10x10 and give the pixels any value you want.  Take a look 
at it.  Something like:
<p>
<center>
<table border=4>
<td><pre>
P2
10 10
255
0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110
30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120
40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130
50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140
60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150
70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160
80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170
90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180
</pre></td></table></center><p>
This should look like:

Cool, no?

<h2>Program #1: Pgminfo</h2>

Your first PGM program should take a PGM file
on standard input and report the number of rows, the number of 
columns, the total number of pixels, and the average value of all
the pixels, padded to three decimal places.  Your program should
work on all valid PGM files, and should print out an error (using <b>cerr</b>)
on any invalid PGM file.  Examples of invalid PGM files are:
<UL>
<LI> Those that don't begin with P2.
<LI> Those that don't have non-negative integers after the P2.
<LI> Those that don't have the number 255 after the number of
rows and columns.
<LI> Those that contain the wrong number of pixels after the P2.
This includes having too many pixels.
<LI> Those that contain pixels whose values are not numbers between
0 and 255.
</UL>
<p>
Here is an example of <b>pgminfo</b> running on some of the PGM
files.  Note, I have a few bad PGM files in <b>Bad-1.pgm</b>, etc.
You need to make sure that your output matches mine <i>exactly</i>.
And I mean exactly, meaning the same punctuation, same number of 
spaces, and same capitalization.  Use <b>printf()</b>, not <b>cout</b>.
<pre>
UNIX> <b>pgminfo < Red.pgm</b>
# Rows:         183
# Columns:      235
# Pixels:     43005
Avg Pixel:  120.142
UNIX> <b>pgminfo < Pike.pgm</b>
# Rows:         235
# Columns:      197
# Pixels:     46295
Avg Pixel:   99.932
UNIX> <b>pgminfo < Bad-2.pgm</b>
Bad PGM file -- No column specification
UNIX> <b>pgminfo < Bad-5.pgm</b>
Bad PGM file -- pixel 99 is not a number between 0 and 255
UNIX> <b>pgminfo < Bad-6.pgm</b>
Bad PGM file -- Extra stuff after the pixels
UNIX> 
</pre>
When I print a pixel number, it is zero-indexed.  So the first
pixel is pixel zero.
<hr>

<h2>Program #2: Bigwhite</h2>

This program takes two numbers as its command line arguments -- the
number of rows and the number of columns.  It then writes a PGM
file on standard output which contains that number of rows and columns,
all of white pixels.  Again, you should error check to make sure that
the proper number of command line arguments are given, that they are
integers and in the proper range.  On an error, print the error statement
to <b>stderr</b>.  As an example, try:
<p>
<pre>
UNIX> <b>bigwhite 20 10 > a.pgm</b>
</pre>
This will create a PGM file <b>a.pgm</b>, which has 20 rows and 10
columns of white pixels.
<p>
Your output in this and the next three programs should match mine exactly
when there is an error.  Otherwise, the PGM files that it emits should
be equivalent to mine (they should make the same picture), 
but do not have to have the same output exactly.  

<hr>
<h2>Program #3: Neg</h2>

<b>Neg</b> takes a PGM file on standard input, and prints a PGM
file on standard output that is the negative of the input file.
If the PGM file is not valid (same parameters as <b>pgminfo</b>),
print an error to standard error.
<p>
For example, here is the negative of <b>Red.pgm</b>:
<p>
<center>
<img src=RedNeg.jpg>
</center>
<p>

<hr>
<h2>Program #4: Hflip </h2>

<b>Hflip</b> reads a PGM file on standard input, and prints a
PGM file on standard output.  The output file should be the
horizontal reflection of the input file -- in other words, left is
right and right is left.  
<p>
You'll have to use  a vector for this program.  
<p>
Here's the <b>hflip</b> of <b>Red.pgm</b>:

<p>
<center>
<img src=RedFlip.jpg>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Program #5: Vflip </h2>

<b>Vflip</b> is just like <b>hflip</b>, only it flips the file vertically:

<p>
<center>
<img src=Red-VFlip.jpg>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Just a little about the gradescript</h2>

For all parts but part one, I use the program <b>pgm_compare</b> to compare
your output with mine.  This program takes two command line arguments, which 
should be PGM files, and compares them to make sure that they are equivalent,
even if their formatting is different.
