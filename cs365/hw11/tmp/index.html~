<h2> Homework Assignment 11</h2>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
This assignment will give you practice with Java's concurrency mechanisms. The
last question will have you implement the JTalk lab from CS360, so it will
also give you an opportunity to compare and contrast the C and Java 
implementations (at least for those of you who have taken CS360 or are 
currently taking it). 
<hr>
<ol>
<li> Write a Java program called that simulates a
  bicycle race among a number of threads. Your program must take one
  command line argument representing the number of contestants.
  Each contestant in the bike
  race will be represented by a thread. The bike race is divided into
  4 segments. For each segment, a thread will generate a random number
  between 1000 and 8000 milliseconds, which represents the time it takes
  the contestant to finish that segment of the race. The thread will
  then sleep for this number of milliseconds. When it awakens, it will
  report to a central time keeper that it has completed this segment of
  the race and it will report its time for this segment of the race. When
  the thread has finished all four segments, it will ask the central time
  keeper to add it to a finish queue. 
  <p>
  The central time keeper will be a class that keeps track of the following
  information:
  <ol>
    <li> the cumulative time of each contestant, the number of segments
      completed by each contestant, whether a new segment time has been
      reported since the last score report (more on this shortly), and the 
      time required by the contestant to complete the last segment.
    <li> the finish order of the contestants, which will be represented by
      the order in which the contestants are added to the finish queue. There
      is a slight possibility that one contestant could finish all four segments
      before another contestant, but the race is not over until the contestant
      is in the finish queue!
  </ol>
  <p>
  Every two seconds your program should print an updated scoreboard showing
  each thread's contestant number (which will be a number from 1 to n where
  n is the number of contestants), the number of segments completed by the
  contestant, the contestant's cumulative time to complete these segments, and if
  the thread reported a new result in the last two seconds, then the time of
  the last segment completed by the contestant (this last piece of information will help both you and the
  TA determine what is happening in your program). Once all
  the contestants have finished, your program should print both the final scoreboard
  and the order in which the contestants actually finished, by printing the
  finish queue. You will need to implement a separate thread for this
  reporting task, although you may place the methods for printing the scoreboard
  and the finish queue in the time keeping class (the reporter thread will
  call these methods).
  <p>
  <b>Additional requirements:</b>
  <ol>
    <li> You must use 4 classes for this problem:
      <ol>
	<li> Contestant.java: The thread class for a contestant
	<li> Reporter.java: The thread class for the reporter. I understand
	  that you could do the reporting in main, but I want you to have
	  experience creating separate thread classes.
	<li> TimeKeeper.java: The timekeeping class
	<li> Race.java: The "glue" class that contains main and which creates
	  instances of the TimeKeeper, Contestant, and Reporter classes.
      </ol>
    <li> You must place your classes in a package named <tt>race</tt>.
    <li> Your central time keeper class should use synchronized methods only 
      when it is necessary. 
    <li> Do not use wait or join. Only use sleep for this problem.
  </ol>
  <p>
  <b>Sample Executable</b>
  <p>
  I have included an executable jar file with this assignment. A sample
  invocation for 3 contestants would be:
<pre>
java -jar race.jar 3
</pre>
  
<p>
<li> In the central time keeping class for question 1, there were two methods
  you needed to write (these two methods are mandated by the paragraph that
  describes the Contestant thread):
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> a time reporting method that allows each thread to report its
	time when it completes a segment, and
      <li> a finish method that allows a thread to report that it has finished
	the race.
    </ol>
    For each method, indicate whether or not you made the method synchronized,
    and justify your decision for doing or not doing so.
<p>
<li> Professor <a href=http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank>Jim Plank's</a> JTalk
  assignment implemented in Java. 
  I am modifying it somewhat so that it works for Java. You
  will be creating a chat server using Java threads and Java sockets, rather
  than pthreads and telnet/jtelnet.
  The syntax of your server is (you will have to use a classpath flag with
  all these examples):

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>java jtalk.ChatServer port Chat-Room-Names ...</b></font>
</pre>

For example, if you'd like to serve chat rooms for football, bridge and politics on 
port 8000, you would type:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>java jtalk.ChatServer 8000 Football Bridge Politics</b></font>
</pre>

You will need to be on the server machine when you launch the chat server.
<p>
The syntax for attaching a client to the server is:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>java jtalk.TalkClient hostname portname chatname</b></font>
</pre>

Suppose, I have launched the chat server on hydra4.eecs.utk.edu using port 8000
and a person wishes to attach to the server with the chatname "Dr-Plank". The
person would type:

<pre> 
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>java jtalk.TalkClient hydra4.eecs.utk.edu 8000 Dr-Plank</b></font>
</pre>

Here is a sample chat between a number of users (dark red input is what the
user types in the console window):

To be descriptive, when a client joins, the server sends it information about the current
chat rooms.  The chat room names will be listed lexicographically, and the name of each
person chatting should be listed with each chat room, separated by a space.  
The order of that listing should be the order in which the chatters joined.  
<p>
The client then prompts the user for a chat room. 
It should error check for a bad chat room but do <i>not</i> worry about 
a premature EOF.  Once the person joins the chat room,
a line is sent to all others in the chat room that the person has joined.  Lines entered
by the clients are sent to all the clients in the chat room.
<p>
The server should support <i>any</i> number of clients, and should work seamlessly when 
clients leave, as Goofus, and later Dr-Plank did above.  The server must not 
print any output. Feel free to add output to your server while testing it, but
please remove it in your final submission.
We will only test the behavior of the clients.
<p>
<b>Structure</b>
<p>
This lab is involved, and will use Java threads, synchronized methods (in place
of the C mutexes and condition variables you used in the CS360 C implementation),
and Java sockets. If you are having trouble getting started with the lab,
look at the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/clientServer.html">Java KnockKnock server socket tutorial</a>, as its structure
is what you should start with. At the bottom of the tutorial is an implementation
for a multi-client KnockKnock server, which is what I used to start writing
the client and server classes for this assignment.
<p>
Suppose 
there are <i>r</i> chat rooms <i>c</i> clients.  
Then your <b>ChatServer</b> will 
have <i>c+1</i> threads and <i>r</i> instances of a chat room class named
<tt>ChatData</tt> that will handle the message traffic for the chat rooms.
Note that unlike the CS360 JTalk lab, you will not use threads to implement
the chat rooms. 
<p>
Your <i>c+1</i> server threads will be allocated as follows:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> There will be one thread that is spinning on a <b>while()</b> loop, waiting for clients
to attach to the socket.  When it detects a client, it will create a client thread. This thread will be your main method in jtalk.ChatServer. In my 
implementation, this thread also used a sorted map to keep track of the
names of the chat rooms and their associated ChatData objects. It passed this
map to each server thread that it forked, so that the server thread could
send that information to the client. You should not use this thread to
determine which chat room the client intends to join, since you would tie
up the server and prevent other clients from joining. You want to be in a tight
loop, so let the server threads determine which chat room the client wishes to
join.
<p>
<LI> There will be one server thread for each client. When that thread starts running
it should send the names of the chat rooms and the chat room users to the
client and ask the client to send back a chat room selection. 
The thread should then add the client to the appropriate ChatData object and
then enter a while loop that reads from the socket. That thread will typically be blocked while
reading from the socket.  When it receives a line of text from the socket, it will construct
the proper string from it and notify the appropriate ChatData object. When
the client exits, the thread will drop out of the loop and should ask the
ChatData object to remove the client. Note that unlike the CS360 JTalk lab,
there will not be any subtle issues in dealing with client exit--you will
get a null value when you try to read from the client's input stream and
you can simply fall out of your read loop.
</UL>
<p>
Your synchronized methods and data will be restricted to the ChatData objects.
Each ChatData object needs to keep track of which clients have been allocated
to it, so that it can distribute messages to these clients. My ChatData object
had 4 primary methods:
<p>
<ol>
<li> distributeMessage: broadcasts a message to all clients in this chat room.
<li> addClient: adds a client socket to the data structures for this ChatData
  object and creates a message indicating that the user has joined the chat
  room. This message is broadcast by distributeMessage.
<li> deleteClient: removes a client socket from the data structures for this
  ChatData object and creates a message indicating that the user has left the
  chat room. This message is broadcast by distributeMessage.
<li> broadcastMembers: writes a list of the chat rooms users to a new client so
  that the client can display the list of users in this chat room.

</ol>
<p>
You are free to design your own implementation of ChatData 
and do not have to use the
above structure.
<p>
The TalkClient class will use main to establish a connection to the server
and select a chat room. You will then face the problem of having to listen
to two input streams: 1) stdin, where the user can enter new messages that
you should send to the server, and 
2) the socket's input stream, which will send you the list of messages to
print in the chat window. You can't listen to two streams at once, since you
will have to block while listening. Hence you will need to fork a thread
that listens to one of the two streams, while main listens to the other 
stream. You will be managing three streams: 1) stdin, 2) the socket's input
stream, and 3) the socket's output stream. You will pass lines from stdin
to the socket's output stream. The output stream will in turn send them 
to the server. Finally, the server will send you lines to print in the console
window via the socket's
input stream.
<p>
You may want to draw yourself some pictures to help visualize the interactions between 
the server client threads, the chat data objects, and the threads on the
client side.

<p>
<b>Example Server and Clients</b>
<p>
I have included two jar files named ChatServer.jar and TalkClient.jar
with this assignment. You can run them if you have questions about how your 
program should work. The output from them is a bit different then the
output in the examples. That is fine. Add blank lines if you like to make
the output easier to read.
<p>
<hr>
<li> <b>Extra Credit (30 points)</b>: 
  Do the online SAIS evaluation for me and any of the TAs
  you wish to, and then print a copy of the confirmation page and
  give it to me at the beginning of class.
  I will be accepting printed copies through Thursday, April 24. This is
  the same extra credit as in homework 10. I'm just reminding you of
  the opportunity.
</ol>
<hr>
<h3> What To Submit </h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Question 1: An executable jar file named <tt>race.jar</tt> that 
  contains your 4 source files.
<li> Question 2: An ascii text file or pdf file labeled hw11
<li> Question 3: Two executable jar files named <tt>ChatServer.jar</tt>
  and <tt>TalkClient.jar</tt>. ChatServer.jar should contain your source
  files, which at a minimum must include:
  <ol>
    <li> ChatServer.java: Your main program for the server
    <li> TalkClient.java: Your main program for the client
    <li> ChatData.java: The class that manages the message traffic for
      each chat room.
  </ol>
  You will also need separate .java files on the server side for the
  server thread class and on the client side for the client thread class 
  (i.e., the class that listens to either the stdin input stream or the
  socket's input stream).
</ol>
