This lecture focuses on programming with sockets, as implemented 
by the program 
<a href=sockettome.c><b>sockettome.c</b></a>.

<p>Sockets are the most general way of performing interprocess communication
(usually abbreviated IPC) in Unix.  We have seen other ways of performing
IPC.  For example, processes can communicate through files and through
pipes.  However, both of those are limited.  For example, the only way
that two processes can communicate through a pipe is if one process has
been forked by the other.  Often we would like to have two processes
talk with each other when they are otherwise unrelated.  For example,
they can be created by different shells, different users, or on different
machines.  Sockets let us do this.

<p>The Unix socket interface is one of the more arcane things you'll ever
run into.  It is for that reason that instead of using that
directly, you'll be using the following three procedures from 
<b>sockettome.c</b>:

<p><i>(On some machines, you have to use some special linking options -- 
When you make your final executable,  On others, you don't need it -- be
prepared to be flexible when you're testing your code on multiple machines.)</i>

<pre>
extern int serve_socket(int port);
		/* This serves a socket on the current machine with the given 
		   port number.  It returns an fd for that socket.  */

extern int accept_connection(int s);
		/* This accepts a connection on the given socket (i.e.
                   it should only be called by the server).  It returns
                   the fd for the connection.  This fd is of course r/w */

extern int request_connection(char *hn, int port);
		/* This is what the client calls to connect to a server's
                   port.  It returns the fd for the connection. */
</pre>
Sockets work as follows:

<p>One process ``serves'' a socket.  By doing this, it tells the operating
system to set up a ``port'' identified by a port number.  This is the
handle by which other processes may connect with the serving process.
There is a nice analogy of sockets to a telephone.  A socket is like
a telephone, and the port number is like a telephone number.  The
machine name is like the area code.  Thus, in order for someone to
"call you up", they need to request a connection to your area
code/port number, just like making a phone call.  

<p>When you "serve" a socket, you are setting yourself up with a
telephone and a telephone number.  The result of serving a socket is
a file descriptor.  However, it is not a normal file descriptor upon
which you may read and write.  Instead, the only things you can
really do with it are close it (which tells Unix to not let other
processes connect to that port), or accept connections on it. 

<p>The server accepts a connection on a socket fd by calling
<b>accept_connection()</b>.  <b>Accept_connection()</b> 
only returns when another
process has connected to the socket.  It returns a new file
descriptor which is that connection.  This descriptor is r/w.  In
other words if you <b>write()</b> to it, the bytes will go to the connected
process, and if you <b>read()</b> from it, it will read bytes written by the
other process. 

<p>"on-serving processes connect with serving ones with
<b>request_connection()</b>.  This means to connect with the process that has
served the socket with the given port number on the given host
machine.  This is like initiating a phone call.  It returns a file
descriptor for its end of the connection. 

<p>Once a socket has been served, it may be connected to multiple times.
That is, the serving process may call <b>accept_connection()</b> any number
of times, as long as there are other processes calling
<b>request_connection()</b> to that machine and port number.  This is kind
of like having multiple phone lines with one telephone number.
This will be useful when you write <b>jtalk</b> with more than 2 people. 

<hr>
Let's look at some example code.  Look at 
<b><a href=serve1.c>serve1.c</a></b>;

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include "sockettome.h"

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *un, c, s[1000];
  int port, sock, fd;

  if (argc != 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: serve1 port\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  port = atoi(argv[1]);
  if (port &lt; 5000) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: serve1 hostname port\n");
    fprintf(stderr, "       port must be &gt; 5000\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  un = getenv("USER");

  sock = serve_socket(port);
  fd = accept_connection(sock);

  printf("Connection established.  Sending `Server: %s'\n", un);
  sprintf(s, "Server: %s\n", un);
  write(fd, s, strlen(s));

  printf("Receiving:\n\n");
  do {
    if (read(fd, &c, 1) != 1) {
      printf("Socket Closed Prematurely\n");
      exit(0);
    } else putchar(c);
  } while (c != '\n');

  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>
<p><b>Serve1.c</b> takes one argument -- the port number of a 
socket to serve.  This port number should be greater
than 5000.  This is because smaller port numbers may be used for other
Unix programs.

<p><b>Serve1.c</b> serves a socket and then waits to
accept a connection.  Once it receives that
connection, it sends the string <b>"Server: "</b>, then
the username of the owner of the serving process,
and a newline to the other end of the connection.
Then it reads bytes from the connection and
prints them out until it gets a newline.  Once
done, it exits.  

You can test <b>serve1</b> by running a <b>telnet</b> client on another machine.  
<b>Telnet</b> is a generic client that attaches to a server, then it does two things:
<p>
<OL> 
<LI> It reads lines from standard input and sends them along the connection.
<LI> It reads lines from the socket and prints them to standard output.
</OL>

Below, I run the server on hydra3, and the client on my Macintosh.  I have padded this output with
extra lines so that you can see the timing of things relative to each other.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top>

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>serve1 5555</b></font>

Connection established.  Sending `Server: plank'
Receiving:

UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>
</td>
<td valign=top>
On my Macintosh:<hr>
<pre>

UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>telnet hydra3.eecs.utk.edu 5555</b></font>

Connected to hydra3.eecs.utk.edu.

<font color=darkred><b>The moment I wake up, before I put on my makeup....</b></font>
Connection closed by foreign host.
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>
</td></table></center><p>

As you can see, the two processes connect with each other and send the bytes
back and forth.  Easy enough.  Now, a few mundane details.  First, suppose I try to run the
server again quickly:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>serve1 5555</b></font>
bind(): Address already in use
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

This happens because the operating system holds the port number typically for two minutes
before allowing you to reuse it.  Be prepared.  
<p>

If you look at that <b>do/while</b> loop above, you'll not that it's really inefficient.  It
reads one character at a time, and we know from our experience with buffering that this is
a bad thing.  You may want to try doing <b>read()</b>'s of larger numbers.  That's a fine thing,
but you need to be aware that with sockets, <i>any</i> number of bytes can come back from 
a <b>read()</b> call -- it does not necessarily have to match the corresponding <b>write()</b>
call, or newlines, or, frankly, anything.  
That makes it a pain to do things like reading until you receive a newline.  You may
be tempted to the <b>do/while</b> loop above, but please resist the temptation.  There is a 
better way, illustrated in the next program:
<p>
<b><a href=serve2.c>Serve2.c</a></b> changes <b>serve1.c</b> in how it writes to the client:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *hn, *un;
  int port, sock, fd;
  int i;
  char s[1000];
  FILE *fsock;

  <font color=darkred><b>.... Error check, serve the socket, start the connection and send a string.</b></font>

  printf("Receiving:\n\n");

  fsock = fdopen(fd, "r");

  if (fgets(s, 1000, fsock) == NULL) {
    printf("Error -- socket closed\n");
  } else {
    printf("%s", s);
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<b>Fdopen()</b> is just like <b>fopen()</b>, except it takes an open
file descriptor as an argument rather than a file.  This allows you
to use the familiar primitives from the standard I/O library, which
have been implemented with sockets in mind.  In particular, they do
the proper buffering and read retrying to make sure that you read
what you want efficiently.  In <b>serve2.c</b>, we use <b>fgets()</b>
to read the line from the client.

<hr>
<h2>Adding a client</h2>

<b><a href=client1.c>Client1.c</a></b>
is very similar to <b>serve2.c</b>.  It simply has a client connect using
<b>request_connection()</b>.  It receives the line of text from the server and sends a line of
its own.  Here it is working:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top>
On hydra3:<hr>
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>serve2 5555</b></font>
Connection established.  Sending `Server: plank'
Receiving:

Client: plank
UNIX> 
</pre>
</td>
<td valign=top>
On my Macintosh:<hr>
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>client1 hydra3.eecs.utk.edu 5555</b></font>
Connection established.  Receiving:

Received: Server: plank
Sending `Client: plank' to the server
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>
</td></table></center><p>

Go over both programs until you understand all this.  If you run
"<b>client1</b>" before "<b>serve2</b>", that's ok.  It will wait until
the socket is served.  

<p><b>Client1</b> can be run from any machine and any user.  
For example, 
I got Dr. Vander Zanden to try
this from his machine:

His output:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>client1 hydra3.eecs.utk.edu 5001</b></font>
Connection established.  Receiving:

Received: Server: plank
Sending `Client: bvz' to the server
UNIX>
</pre>

and mine:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>serve1 5001</b></font>
Connection established.  Sending `Server: plank'
Receiving:

Client: bvz
UNIX1>
</pre>

<h2>Alternate</h2>

Now, suppose I want to write a limited version of "talk" -- It will let
a server/client pair establish a connection, and then alternate sending
lines to one another.  
This is in
<a href=alternate.c><b>alternate.c</b></a>.
Each process alternates reading a line from <b>stdin</b> and sending
it along the socket, and then reading a line from the socket and sending
it along <b>stdout</b>.

<p>Try running <b>alternate</b> from two windows on the same machine, or from 
two different machines, or from two different users on different machines.

Here is an example of the server on hydra3 and the client on my Macintosh.  
Pay attention to the part where the client writes before the server is ready
(it's the line "While combing my hair now), and what the output is:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top>
On hydra3:<hr>
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>alternate hydra3.eecs.utk.edu 5555 s</b></font>

Connection established.  Client should start talking

<font color=darkred><b>Before I put on my make up</b></font>

<h2>Minitalk</h2>

You'll note that <b>alternate</b> isn't totally useful.  What you'd like is
for each end of the connection to simultaneously wait for the user to 
type a line in on <b>stdin</b> and for a line to come in from the socket.  
You'll be able to do that with <b>select()</b> which we'll go over next lecture.
Until then, you can hack up a version of <b>talk()</b> which uses 4 total
processes -- two for the client and two for the server.  One 
client-server pair just lets the client type lines in and it prints
it out to the server, and the other lets the server type lines in 
and it prints it out to the client.  This is in 
<a href=minitalk.c><b>minitalk.c</b></a>.
Note
that minitalk <b>dups</b> the <b>fd</b> onto 0 or 1 depending on whether the 
process is the parent or child, and then exec's cat in all four processes.
This is a real hack, but it works -- you have the server parent 
reading from its stdin and sending the output along the socket to the
client child, and likewise from the client parent to the server child.

<p>
Here's the relevant code:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  .....

  printf("Connection made -- input goes to remote site\n");
  printf("                   output comes from remote site\n");

  if (fork() == 0) {
    dup2(fd, 0);
  } else {
    dup2(fd, 1);
  }
  close(fd);
  execlp("cat", "cat", 0);
  fprintf(stderr, "Exec failed.  Drag\n");
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<p>The only problem with <b>minitalk</b> is that once one of the processes dies,
the others don't automatically follow suit.  Think about why.
Also think about what would happen if you swapped the parent and the child (in other
words, if you had the parent perform <b>dup2(fd, 0)</b> and the child perform
<b>dup2(fd, 1)</b>.  Try it to test yourself.
<p>
When you run minitalk, after you finish, type "ps" and kill extraneous
"cat" processes.

You can fix the problem by adding another process to the mix.  Instead of 
forking one process, you fork two, and have them both do the <b>execlp</b>
of <b>cat</b>.  Then you call <b>wait()</b>, and when one of the processes
dies, you kill the other one.  That cleans up all of the processes -- try it
for yourself!  The code is in 
<b><a href=minitalk2.c>minitalk2.c</a></b> -- here's the relevant section:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *hn;
  int port, sock, fd;
  int pid1, pid2, p, dummy;

<font color=darkred>.........</font>

  pid1 = fork();
  if (pid1 == 0) {
    dup2(fd, 0);
  } else {
    pid2 = fork();
    if (pid2 == 0) {
      dup2(fd, 1);
    } else {
      close(fd);
      close(0);
      close(1);
      p = wait(&dummy);
      kill((p == pid1) ? pid2 : pid1, SIGKILL);
      exit(0);
    }
  }
  close(fd);
  execlp("cat", "cat", NULL);
  fprintf(stderr, "Exec failed.  Drag\n");
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>
