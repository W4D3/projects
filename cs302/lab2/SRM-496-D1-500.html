<h3>Topcoder SRM 496, D1, 500-point problem</h3>

Read over the problem.  When I looked at this, my first thought
was to solve it recursively.  Write the recursive procedure
<b>cvg(int v, int index)</b>, which counts the number of valid
guesses for velocity <b>v</b>, supposing that all balls in 
<b>firstPicture</b> whose indices are less than <i>index</i> have
been matched with balls from <b>secondPicture</b>, and
those matches have been noted somehow.
<p>
The basic outline of <b>cvg()</b> will be:
<p>
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
long long OneDimensionalBalls::cvg(int v, int index)
{
  long long rv;

  rv = 0;

  for (i = -1; i &lt;= 1; i += 2) {
    if (firstPicture[index]+v*i is in secondPicture) {
      if (index+1 == firstPicture.size()) {
        rv++;
      } else {
        remove the ball from secondPicture that equals firstPicture[index]+v*i;
        rv += cvg(v, index+1);
        put the ball back
      }
    }
  }
  return rv;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>
    
This solution will work for small sizes, but the fact that it returns a 
<b>long long</b> should clue you in that something isn't right.  Regardless,
it's worth hacking up for practice.  Here is a first pass, in 
<b><a href=ODB_Rec1.cpp>ODB_Rec1.cpp</a></b>.  First, I save <b>firstPicture</b>
and <b>secondPicture</b> as <b>FP</b> and <b>SP</b>.  That way, my recursive 
procedure always has access to them.  I also have two more members: <b>Matched</b>
is a vector, which is the same size as <b>SP</b>.  If <b>Matched[i]</b> is true,
then element <i>i</i> of <b>SP</b> has been matched from a previous call to <b>cvb</b>.
<b>SP_Balls</b> is a map such that if <b>SP[i] = j</b>, then <b>SP_Balls[i] = j</b>.
It lets us find out quickly whether a ball with a given value is in <b>SP</b>.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class OneDimensionalBalls {
  public:
    long long countValidGuesses(vector &lt;int&gt; firstPicture, vector &lt;int&gt; secondPicture);
    long long cvg(int v, int index);
    vector &lt;int&gt; FP;
    vector &lt;int&gt; SP;
    vector &lt;int&gt; Matched;
    map &lt;int, int&gt; SP_Balls;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Given that backdrop, <b>cvg</b> works as above, except it fills in the pseudo-code
with code that uses <b>Matched</b> and <b>SP_Balls</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
long long OneDimensionalBalls::cvg(int v, int index)
{
  long long rv;
  int second_val, sb_index;
  map &lt;int, int&gt;::iterator mit;
  int i;

  rv = 0;

  for (i = -1; i &lt;= 1; i += 2) {
    second_val = FP[index]+v*i;
    mit = SP_Balls.find(second_val);
    if (mit != SP_Balls.end() && !(Matched[mit-&gt;second])) {
      if (index+1 == FP.size()) {
        rv++;
      } else {
        Matched[mit-&gt;second] = 1;
        rv += cvg(v, index+1);
        Matched[mit-&gt;second] = 0;
      }
    }
  }
  return rv;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Finally, the code for <b>countValidGuesses()</b> needs to set up <b>FP</b>, 
<b>SP</b>, <b>Matched</b> and <b>SP_Balls</b>, and just for testing, it calls
<b>cvg</b> with a velocity of one:
<p>
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
long long OneDimensionalBalls::countValidGuesses(
      vector &lt;int&gt; firstPicture, 
      vector &lt;int&gt; secondPicture)
{
  int i;

  FP = firstPicture;
  SP = secondPicture;
  Matched.resize(SP.size(), 0);
  VIT(i, secondPicture) SP_Balls[SP[i]] = i;

  return cvg(1, 0);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

To compile and run this, I use my standard topcoder-programming trick of having 
a driver program that includes this program and runs the examples.  This
is in 
<b><a href=SRM-496-Driver.cpp>SRM-496-Driver.cpp</a></b>.  To compile, you need
to copy your program to <b>OneDimensionalBalls.cpp</b>, and then simply 
compile <b>SRM-496-Driver.cpp</b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cp ODB_Rec1.cpp OneDimensionalBalls.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ SRM-496-Driver.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

With example zero, we have:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
FP = { 12, 11 }
SP = { 10, 11, 13 }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Thus, when <b>v=1</b>, we should have two sets of legal guesses: 11 goes to 10 and 12 goes to 
either 11 or 13.
When we run it, it gives us the correct answer:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>a.out 0</b></font>
2
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

You can also call <b>a.out</b> with -1 as an argument, and that allows you to put the
two vectors of integers on standard input:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat tmp.txt</b></font>
12 11
10 11 13
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>a.out -1 < tmp.txt</b></font>
2
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Now, what velocities should we use?  The only ones that will be legal are velocities 
equal to the difference between each ball in <b>SP</b> and <b>FP[0]</b>.  The 
code to enumerate these uses a <b>set</b>, because you don't want to test the same 
velocity twice (in the example above, the differences are 2, 1 and 1)
(code in <b><a href=ODB_Rec2.cpp>ODB_Rec2.cpp</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
long long OneDimensionalBalls::countValidGuesses(
      vector &lt;int&gt; firstPicture, 
      vector &lt;int&gt; secondPicture)
{
  int i, d;
  set &lt;int&gt; velocities;
  set &lt;int&gt;::iterator vit;
  long long rv;

  FP = firstPicture;
  SP = secondPicture;
  Matched.resize(SP.size(), 0);
  VIT(i, secondPicture) SP_Balls[SP[i]] = i;

  VIT(i, SP) {
    d = SP[i] - FP[0];
    if (d &lt; 0) d = -d;
    if (d != 0) velocities.insert(d);
  }

  rv = 0;
  IT(vit, velocities) rv += cvg(*vit, 0);
  return rv;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When we run this, it works on all the test cases:

<pre>
UNIX> cp ODB_Rec2.cpp OneDimensionalBalls.cpp
UNIX> g++ SRM-496-Driver.cpp
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>a.out 0</b></font>
3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>a.out 1</b></font>
0
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>a.out 2</b></font>
1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>a.out 3</b></font>
6
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>a.out 4</b></font>
7
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

So compile and submit????  You should be worried.  Each recursive case can make two
recursive calls, and if there are roughly 25 levels of recursive calls, your code
may take on the order of <i>2<sup>25</sup></i> operations.  That's too much.  Indeed,
when I compiled and submitted, it choked on the following input:


<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
FP = { 9, 10, ..., 39, 40 }
SP = { 1, 2, 3, ..., 49, 50 }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

I put that into case 6 in <b>SRM-496-Driver.cpp</b>, and <b>"a.out 6"</b> takes much longer than
the requisite 2 seconds.  Dang, back to the drawing board.  At least we've had some
more practice with maps and sets.
<p>
When you learn about dynamic programming later, you'll see that memoization doesn't
work here either.

<h3>Giving the problem more thought.</h3>

Instead, let's think more about the problem.  Again, we'll restrict our attention to
velocity <i>v</i>.  Each ball in <b>FP</b> can be matched to zero, one or two 
balls in <b>SP</b>.  If zero, then there's no valid guess.  You can return zero.  
If one, there is only
one potential valid guess, and you can remove the ball from <b>FP</b> and remove its
corresponding ball from <b>SP</b>.  At this point, you can also remove all balls 
from <b>SP</b> that don't match to any balls in <b>FP</b>.  Let's take a look at
such a system.  Example 4 from the problem suffices:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
FP = { 2, 4, 6 }
SP = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

We have 5 potential values of <i>v</i>: 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6.  I draw the <b>SP</b> and
their matching <b>FP</b> for the first four of these below:

<p><center><table border=3>
   <tr><td><img src=SRM-496-500-Ex1.jpg width=300></td>
       <td><img src=SRM-496-500-Ex2.jpg width=300></td></tr>
   <tr><td><img src=SRM-496-500-Ex3.jpg width=300></td>
       <td><img src=SRM-496-500-Ex4.jpg width=300></td></tr>
</table></center><p>

Let's consider the simplest: <i>v=5</i>.  In this case, 4 cannot be matched to anything,
so there are zero valid guesses. (The same is true of <i>v=6</i>, which is not drawn).
<p>
Next, let's consider <i>v=2</i>.  In this case, 2 and 4 match to one number in <b>SP</b>.
We can thus remove them from the system.  When we do so, 6 matches to one number, and we 
remove it.  We are left with an empty system.  That corresponds to one
valid guess.  
<p>
How about when <i>v=3</i>?  Here, 2 and 6 each match to one number, so they can be removed
from the system.  We can also remove any balls in <b>SP</b> that don't match any balls in 
<b>FP</b> (at this point, the only ball in <b>FP</b> is 4), so we're left with:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=SRM-496-500-Ex5.jpg width=300></td></table></center><p>

There are two ways to perform this match, so there are two valid matches.  The last case is
<i>v=1</i>, which requires a little more thought.  Let's look for a pattern.  When
we have a system that looks like:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=SRM-496-500-Ex8.jpg width=132></td></table></center><p>

As we said above, this corresponds to two valid guesses.  Let's make it a little more
complex:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=SRM-496-500-Ex7.jpg width=199></td></table></center><p>

If we have the leftmost number in <b>FP</b> match the leftmost in <b>SP</b>, then there are
two ways to match the remaining elements (since it's equal to the previous picture). 
If we have the leftmost number in <b>FP</b> match the second element in <b>SP</b>, 
then there is just one way to match the remaining element.  That makes three ways in total.
<p>
Let's make it a little more complex still:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=SRM-496-500-Ex6.jpg width=267></td></table></center><p>

If we have the leftmost number in <b>FP</b> match the leftmost in <b>SP</b>, then there are
three ways to match the remaining elements (since it's equal to the previous picture). 
If we have the leftmost number in <b>FP</b> match the second element in <b>SP</b>, 
then there is just one way to match the remaining elements.  That makes four ways in total.
<p>
Do you see the pattern?  If you have a set of <i>n</i> elements in <b>FP</b>, then they 
will match to the elements in <b>SP</b> in <i>n+1</i> ways.  Thus, the <i>v=1</i>
case in Example 4 has four matches.  The answer to example 4 is thus 4 + 1 + 2 = 7.
<p>
If we have multiple sets of matching elements, we have to multiply their
number of guesses.  For example, suppose we have:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=SRM-496-500-Ex9.jpg width=500></td></table></center><p>

The first set matches in two ways, the second in four, and the third in three.  Thus, the
total number of matches is 2*4*3 = 24.
<p>
Let's take one final concrete and complex example to make sure that we understand.  
Suppose our system looks like:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=SRM-496-500-ExA.jpg width=500></td></table></center><p>

The first thing that we do is remove the numbers in <b>FP</b> (4, 15 and 22), 
that only match one number in <b>SP</b>.  We also remove their matches in <b>SP</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=SRM-496-500-ExB.jpg width=500></td></table></center><p>

We're left with more numbers in <b>FP</b> (2 and 20) that only match one number in <b>SP</b>.
We keep removing them and their corresponding numbers in <b>SP</b> until we only are left
with numbers that have two corresponding numbers in <b>SP</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=SRM-496-500-ExC.jpg width=500></td></table></center><p>

From our discussion above, this one has four ways to be matched.

<hr>
<h3>Turning this into code</h3>

Now we know what we want to do -- we have to code it up.  I think that a good way 
to start is to represent each ball as its own instance of a <b>Ball</b> class.  We'll
define it:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Ball {
  public:
    int val;
    Ball *low;
    Ball *high;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<b>Val</b> is its value, and <b>low</b> and <b>high</b> are pointers to other balls.
If <b>b</b> is in <b>FP</b>, then <b>low</b> points to the ball in <b>SP</b> whose
values is <b>b->val-v</b>.  If there is no such ball, then it is <b>NULL</b>.
Similarly, <b>b->high</b> points to the ball in <b>SP</b> whose
values is <b>b->val+v</b>.  If there is no such ball, then it is <b>NULL</b>.

<p>
The balls in <b>SP</b> point to the balls in <b>FP</b>.  To be precise, 
If <b>b</b> is in <b>SP</b>, then <b>b->low</b> points to the ball in <b>FP</b> whose
values is <b>b->val-v</b>.  If there is no such ball, then it is <b>NULL</b>.
<b>b->high</b> is defined similarly.

<p>
When we call <b>cvg()</b> we just call it with a velocity.  We then set up the balls
and their pointers.  Then, we do the following:
<UL>
<LI> Check all the balls in <b>FP</b>.  If any don't have a valid <b>low</b> or <b>high</b>,
then return 0, becuase there is no valid guess.
<p>
<LI> Check all the balls in <b>FP</b>.  If any ball <b>b</b> has 
just one valid <b>low</b> or <b>high</b>,
then remove it and the ball in <b>SP</b> that it points to.  In doing that, you may have to
remove other pointers, becuase there may be another ball pointing to the ball in <b>SP</b>.
<p>
<LI> Keep repeating this step until the only balls in <b>FP</b> have two pointers.
Now, identify all the sets of balls like those in the last picture, determine how
many valid guesses correspond to each, and multiply them.
</UL>
