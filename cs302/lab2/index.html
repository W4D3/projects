<p>
Your assignment is simple:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> <b>Part 1</b>: Do the 500-point problem from Topcoder SRM 496, Division 1. 
If you can't get to it on topcoder, you can read the 
description <a href=http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=11318&rd=14425>here.</a>
You <i>must</i> solve it as I describe in 
the <a href=SRM-496-D1-500.html>notes on SRM-496-D1-500</a>.  You must comment
your code very cleanly, and explain each step that you do.  You are <i>not</i> 
allowed to solve this code in a different manner than the one I describe.  That's
because it's too easy to cut and paste other people's code from Topcoder.
<p>
To compile this, go ahead and grab
<b><a href=SRM-496-Driver.cpp>SRM-496-Driver.cpp</a></b> from the lab directory.
Make sure your program is in the file <b>OneDimensionalBalls.cpp</b>.  Then, when
you execute the command ``<b>g++ SRM-496-Driver.cpp</b>,'' it will compile the
driver with your implementation.  The result will be in <b>a.out</b>.

<p>
<LI> <b>Part 2</b>: Do the 500-point problem from Topcoder SRM 337, Division 1. 
If you can't get to topcoder, you may read the description
<a href=http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=7473&rd=10661>here</a>.
I have <a href=SRM-337-D1-500.html>notes to help you</a>.  
Once again, your commenting here must be flawless, and must describe each step
that you are doing, so that the TA's can be sure that you know what you're doing.
<p>
To compile this, grab
<b><a href=SRM-337-Driver.cpp>SRM-337-Driver.cpp</a></b> from the lab directory.
Make sure your program is in the file <b>BuildingAdvertise.cpp</b>.  Then, when
you execute the command ``<b>g++ SRM-496-Driver.cpp</b>,'' it will compile the
driver with your implementation.  The result will be in <b>a.out</b>.
</UL>
<hr>
In each case, you will get a zero if your code takes three seconds or longer on
an unloaded machine (type <b>top</b> to find out if anyone is CPU-hogging your
machines).
The whole point of this lab is to use the proper data
structures to make your programs run in <i>O(n </i>log<sub>2</sub><i> n)</i>
time.

<p>
You will only submit two files: 
<b>OneDimensionalBalls.cpp</b>
and
<b>BuildingAdvertise.cpp</b>.  The TA's will compile them with the drivers
and run the gradescript on them.

<p>
<h3>For the gradescript</h3>

Go ahead and compile the first program and move the executable to <b>a.out-496</b>.
Put the second one's executable into <b>a.out-337</b>.  Then the gradescript runs
as normal.   The gradeall also tells you a rough timing of your program.
