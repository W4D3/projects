<h2>What you hand in</h2>

You need to submit the source code for two programs: <b>sb-analyze.cpp</b> 
and <b>sb-play.cpp</b>.

<h2>Also</h2>
Every year, someone asks me for the source to <b>sb-player</b>.  Sorry, but I can't give it out, 
because it's too easy to modify it to solve the lab.  I can try to make an <b>sb-player</b>
binary for your machine, and if you want modifications, I'll listen.  Let me know.
<p>
There is an <b>sb-player</b> binary for macs in <b>sb-player-mac</b>.

<hr>
<h2>Disjoint Sets</h2>

Use the disjoint sets code from the lecture notes.  Don't change <b>DJ.h</b>.  When
the TA's grade, they should be able to use <b>DJ.h</b> and any of the three implementations
from the lecture notes, and your programs should work.

<p>

<hr>
<h2>Superball</h2>

Superball is a simplistic game that was part of a games CD for my old
Windows 95 box.  It works as follows.  You have a 8x10 grid which is
the game board.  Each cell of the game board may be empty or hold
a color:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> P - Purple: worth 2 points.
<LI> B - Blue: worth 3 points.
<LI> Y - Yellow: worth 4 points.
<LI> R - Red: worth 5 points.
<LI> G - Green: worth 6 points.
</UL>

The board starts with five random colors set.  On your turn, you may
do one of two things:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> You may swap two cells.  After the swap, five new random 
cells will be filled with a random colors.
<LI> You may "score" a cell.  To score a cell, the cell must
be one of the "goal" cells, and there are sixteen of these,
in rows 2-5, columns 0, 1, 8 and 9.  (Everything is zero
indexed).  Moreover, there must be at least five touching
cells of the same color, one of which must be the goal cell
that you want to score.  When you score, you get the sum
of the cells connected to the cell that you are scoring, 
and then all of those cells leave the board, and three new
random ones are added.
</UL>
<p>
I have a tcl/tk/shell-scripted Superball player at <b>/home/plank/Superball</b>.
Simply copy that directory to your home directory:
<p>
<pre>
UNIX> </b>cp -r /home/plank/Superball $HOME</b>
</pre>
<p>
Then you can play it with <b>~/Superball/Superball</b>.  The
high score probably won't work -- you'll have to change the 
<b>open</b> command in the file <b>hscore</b> to the name of
your web browser.
<p>
Let's look at some screen shots.  Suppose we fire up <b>Superball</b>:
<p>
<center><img src=SS1.jpg></center>
<p>
The "goal" cells are marked with asterisks, and there are five non-empty
cells.  Our only legal action is to swap two cells -- I'm going to swap 
cells [3,6] and [5,8].  This will make those two blue cells contiguous.
In the game, I do that by clicking on the two cells that I want to swap.
Afterwards, five new cells are put on the screen.  Here's the screen shot:
<p>
<center><img src=SS2.jpg></center>
<p>
I do a bunch more swaps and end up with the  following board: 
<p>
<center><img src=SS3.jpg></center>
<p>
I can score the green cells by clicking on cell [2,1], [3,0], [3,1]  or [4,0] and then clicking
"Collect".  This will score that group of eight green squares, which gets me 
48 points (8*6), and three new cells will be added:
<p>
<center><img src=SS4.jpg></center>
<p>

There are no cells to score here (the blues ones in the lower right-hand part
of the board only compose a group of four).  So I revert to swapping.
Suppose I keep doing so until I reach:

<p>
<center><img src=SS5.jpg></center>
<p>

I'm in trouble.  I've got these beautiful groups of red, green and purple cells, but
I can't score any of them because they are not connected to a goal call.  Dang.  I can
only score those two groups of blue cells.    When I do that, I'm only left
with four open squares, and I can't score anything:

<p>
<center><img src=SS6.jpg></center>
<p>

Perhaps I should have been a little more thoughtful while playing the game.  Regardless, I'm stuck. 
I simply swap two random squares and end the game:

<p>
<center><img src=SS7.jpg></center>
<p>

Oh well -- should have done that swap a little sooner....
<hr>
For this lab, we are going to deal with a text-based version of the game.  
Our programs will have the following parameters:
<UL>
<LI> <b>rows</b> - the number of rows on the game board.  Although
the tcl/tk version has that set to eight, our programs will handle any number.
<LI> <b>cols</b> - the number of columns on the game board. 
<LI> <b>min-score-size</b> - the number of contiguous cells that have to be
together in order to score them.  This is 5 in the tcl/tk version
<LI> <b>colors</b> - this must be a string of distinct lower-case 
letters.  They represent that the colors that a cell can have.  The 
point value of the first of these is 2, and each succeeding character
is worth one more point.  To have the same values as the tcl/tk game, this parameter should be "pbyrg". 
</UL>
<p>
I have written an interactive game player.  I'll discuss all the parameters later.  Call it as
done below:
<p>
<pre>

Your Move:

The format of the board is as follows: 
When a letter is capitalized, it is on a goal cell.  
Dots and asterisks stand
for empty cells -- asterisks are on the goal cells.  
If you click on the
<b>Print Boards</b> button in the tcl/tk game, it will print out each board on 
standard output in that format.  That's nice for testing.
<p>
You can type two commands:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
SWAP r1 c1 r2 c2
SCORE r c
</pre></td></table></center><p>

In the board above, you can't score anything, so you'll have to swap.  We'll
swap the blue cell in [2,2] with the green one in [7,2]:

<center><table border=3><td>

You'll note, I could have scored cell [5,0] when there were 35 empty cells, but I really
wanted to make that patch of red cells bigger.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Program #1: Sb-read</h3>

I have written <b><a href=sb-read.cpp>sb-read.cpp</a></b> for you.  This program 
takes the four parameters detailed above, reads in a game board with those parameters
and prints out some very basic information.  For example, the following board:

<p><center><img src=SS8.jpg></center><p>

May be represented by the following text 
(in <b><a href=input-1.txt>input-1.txt</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
...yyryy.p
y.rg.yppyp
**gg.yrpPP
GGgbgybp**
R*bg.yrp*P
G*gygyypY*
yyybpby.pb
.pgg.yp.bb
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When we run <b>sb-read</b> on it, we get the following:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>sb-read 8 10 5 pbyrg < input-1.txt</b></font>
Empty cells:                    20
Non-Empty cells:                60
Number of pieces in goal cells:  8
Sum of their values:            33
UNIX> 
</pre>

There are three purple pieces in goal cells, one yellow, three
green and one red.  That makes a total of 3*2 + 4 + 5 + 3*6 = 33.
<p>
You should take a look at 
<b><a href=sb-read.cpp>sb-read.cpp</a></b>.
In particular, look 
at the <b>Superball</b> class:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Superball {
  public:
    Superball(int argc, char **argv);
    int r;
    int c;
    int mss;
    int empty;
    vector &lt;int&gt; board;
    vector &lt;int&gt; goals;
    vector &lt;int&gt; colors;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<b>Mss</b> is min-score-size.  <b>Empty</b> is the number of 
empty cells in the board.  <b>Board</b> is a vector of <b>r * c</b>
integers.  The element in [i,j] is in entry <b>board[i*c+j]</b>, and
is either '.', '*' or a lower case letter.  
<b>goals</b> is another array of <b>r * c</b> integers.  It is equal
to 0 if the cell is not a goal cell, and 1 
if it is a goal cell.  <b>Colors</b> is an array of 256 
elements, which should be indexed by a letter.  Its value is the
value of the letter (e.g. in the above example, <b>colors['p'] = 2</b>).

<p>
<b>sb-read</b> does all manner of error checking for you.  It is a nice
program from which to build your other programs.

<hr>
<h3>Program #2: Sb-analyze</h3>

You are to write this one.
<p>
With <b>sb-analyze</b>, you are to start with <b>sb-read.cpp</b> as a base, and augment
it so that it prints out all possible scoring sets.  For example, in the above
game board (represented by 
<b><a href=input-1.txt>input-1.txt</a></b>), there are two scoring sets -- the 
set of 10 purple cells in the upper right-hand corner, and the set of 6 green
cells on the left side of the screen.  Here is the output to <b>sb_analyze</b>:
<p>
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>sb-analyze</b></font>
usage: sb-analyze rows cols min-score-size colors
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>sb-analyze 8 10 5 pbyrg < input-1.txt</b></font>
Scoring sets:
  Size: 10  Char: p  Scoring Cell: 2,8
  Size:  6  Char: g  Scoring Cell: 3,0
UNIX> 
</pre>
Each set must be printed exactly once, but in any 
order, and with any legal goal cell.  Thus, the following
output would also be ok:
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>sb-analyze 8 10 5 pbyrg < input-1.txt</b></font>
Scoring sets:
  Size:  6  Char: g  Scoring Cell: 3,1
  Size: 10  Char: p  Scoring Cell: 2,9
UNIX> 
</pre>

Think about how you would use the disjoint sets data structure to 
implement this -- it is a straightforward connected components application.  
I would recommend augmenting your <b>Superball</b>
class with a <b>DisjointSet</b>, and then having a method called
<b>analyze_superball()</b>, which performs the analysis. 
<p>
Here's another example:

<p><center><img src=SS9.jpg></center><p>
This is in the file
<b><a href=input-2.txt>input-2.txt</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
yyggyryybp
ggrgpyppyp
RBgggyrpPP
GGgggybpPP
RGygryrpBP
YGyygyypYB
yyybpbyppb
ppggyypbbb
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>sb-analyze 8 10 5 pbyrg < input-2.txt</b></font>
Scoring sets:
  Size: 14  Char: g  Scoring Cell: 5,1
  Size: 15  Char: p  Scoring Cell: 4,9
  Size:  7  Char: y  Scoring Cell: 5,0
  Size:  5  Char: b  Scoring Cell: 5,9
UNIX> 
</pre>


<hr>
<h3>Program #3: Sb-play</h3>

Your next program takes the same arguments and input as <b>sb-analyze</b>.
However, now its job is to print a single move as would be accepted
as input for the <b>sb-player</b> program.  In other words, it
needs to output a SWAP or SCORE line with legal values.
<p>
If you have fewer than five pieces and cannot score any, you
will lose the game -- you should do that by swapping two legal pieces
so that the game can end.
<p>
The <b>sb-player</b> program takes as its 5th argument the name of
a program that it will use for input.  I also have three programs - 
<b>sb-play</b>, <b>sb-play2</b> and <b>sb-play3</b> in that directory.
<b>sb-play</b> simply swaps two random cells until there are fewer
than five empty, then it scores a set if it can.  The other two are
smarter, but are by no means the best one can do.  

<p>
Here's <b>sb-player</b> running on <b>sb-play2</b> (note, <b>sb-player</b> creates
a temporary file, so you must run it from your own directory):
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>/home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab5/sb-player 8 10 5 pbyrg /home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab5/sb-play2 y y -</b></font>
Empty Cells: 75     Score: 0

g.........
..........
**......**
*Pr.....**
**......**
**..p...**
........b.
..........

Type Return for the next play
</pre>
It waits for you to press the return key.  When you do so, it will send the game
board to <b>/home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab5/sp-play2</b> and perform the output.  Here's
what happens:
<pre>
Move is: SWAP 5 4 3 2

Empty Cells: 70     Score: 0

g........g
.......y..
**......**
*Pp.....**
**......G*
**..r...**
..g.....b.
........g.

Type Return for the next play
</pre>
You can bet that the next move will swap that <b>b</b> with one of the <b>g</b>'s:
<pre>
Move is: SWAP 6 8 0 0

Empty Cells: 65     Score: 0

b........g
.......y..
**..b...**
*Pp.g...**
**.....gG*
**..r...**
..g.....g.
.p...p..g.

Type Return for the next play
</pre>

And so on.   If you run it with <b>n</b> for the 6th argument, it will simply run the
program without your input:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>/home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab5/sb-player 8 10 5 pbyrg /home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab5/sb-play2 n y -</b></font>
Empty Cells: 75     Score: 0

..........
..........
**......**
**y..y..**
**......**
*P......**
..........
......p.g.

Move is: SWAP 3 5 3 2

</pre>
<i>... a bunch of output skipped...</i>
<pre>

Empty Cells:  1     Score: 505

yyrrgggpyy
grrbppg.yg
GYbgygggPB
GBggpgbpPB
PPgggggrYB
YBbybgpbYR
pprrrggggr
byyrppppgg

Move is: SWAP 0 1 7 5

Game over.  Final score = 505
UNIX> 
</pre>
Even though there were no good moves at the end, the program did a final
SWAP so that the game could finish.

<p>
If you run with the 7th argument as <b>n</b>, it will only print out the end result, and
the last argument can specify a seed (it uses the current time if that argument is "-"),
so that you can compare multiple players on the same game:
<p>
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>/home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab5/sb-player 8 10 5 pbyrg /home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab5/sb-play n n 1</b></font>
Game over.  Final score = 0
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>/home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab5/sb-player 8 10 5 pbyrg /home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab5/sb-play2 n n 1</b></font>
Game over.  Final score = 855
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>/home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab5/sb-player 8 10 5 pbyrg /home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab5/sb-play3 n n 1</b></font>
Game over.  Final score = 2572
UNIX> 
</pre>
It can take a while for these to run -- if it appears to be hanging, send the process a <b>QUIT</b> 
signal and it will print out what the current score is.

<h3>Shell Script to Run Multiple Times</h3>

The file <b><a href=run_multiple.sh>run_multiple.sh</a></b> is a shell script to run 
the player on multiple seeds and average the results.  Examples:

Obviously, to get a meaningful average, many more runs (than 10) will be
required.
<p>
Oh, and make your programs run in reasonable time.  Roughly 5 seconds for
every thousand points, and if you are burning all that time, your program 
better be killing mine....

<h3>The Superball Challenge</h3>

To get credit, your player needs to average over 100 points on runs of 100 games.  
<p>
I will run a Superball tournament
with all of your players with extra lab points going to the winners:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> 1st place: 40 extra lab points.
<LI> 2nd place: 25 extra lab points.
<LI> 3rd place: 10 extra lab points.
</UL>

I have now performed the challenge four times:
<UL>

<h3>Hints</h3>

Play the game for a bit to try to figure out some strategies.  However, one good way to
write a game player is to figure out a way to come up with a rating for a game board.  Then when you are
faced with making a move, you analyze all potential moves by trying them out and choosing
the one that gives you the resulting board with the highest rating.
