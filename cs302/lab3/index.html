This is a very long lab writeup.  We will go over it in class or lab.  
Please read it <i>thoroughly</i>,
and play around with hand-editing the files before you start writing code.
<p>
You will hand in your <b>cs302-midi.cpp</b> file.  <i>You may not modify 
<b>cs302-midi-base.cpp</b> or <b>cs302-midi.h</b> in any way.</i>

<h2>Introduction: MIDI</h2>

MIDI stands for <i>"Musical Instrument Digital Interface"</i>.  It is a bit of an overloaded
term, so I'll try to give it a succinct explanation here.  If you want more, there's tons
of text about MIDI on 
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface>Wikipedia</a>.
<p>
MIDI is a standard for representing and manipulating note-based music on computers.  Most
electronic instruments, notably keyboards, have MIDI output ports which emit events in 
a specific format whenever the instruments are played.  These events are emitted in real-time,
so that a computer may record them, manipulate them, etc.
<p>
There is a file format called <i>Standard MIDI File (SMF) Format</i>, which records a MIDI 
performance.  These files contain MIDI events that an instrument would emit, plus timing information
about when the various events occur.  A MIDI player will play these events back, using some sort 
of sound synthesizer.
<p>
Most web browsers support SMF files.  For example, 
<b><a href=bach_565.mid>bach_565.mid</a></b> contains a rather tepid
performance of Bach's famous D minor Toccata and Fugue (BWV 565)
(taken from <a href=http://users1.ee.net/lstone/midi.htm><b>http://users1.ee.net/lstone/midi.htm</b></a>).
The file
<b><a href=rockytop.mid>rockytop.mid</a></b> contains a more familiar tune.
When you click on these links, your web browser should play the MIDI
files.  If your computer has a nice expensive sound card, this will
sound pretty good.  If it has a janky one like mine, it will sound
kinda lame.  So it goes.
<p>
The SMF format is far too detailed for this lab.  Instead, we're only going to concern ourselves
with a limited subset of SMF, and we'll use two different representations that are easy to edit
and manipulate.  MIDI files contain <i>tracks</i>, each of which is a different instrument.
A MIDI player will play all of the tracks simultaneously, which can make for a good performance.
We are only going to concentrate on MIDI files with a single track.
<p>
These MIDI files contain linear streams of <i>events</i>.  We will only handle four of these events:
<UL>
<LI> <b>ON</b>: Turn a note on.  The parameters of this event are the pitch of the note and its volume,
each of which is an integer between 1 and 127.
<LI> <b>OFF</b>: Turn a note off.  The parameter of this event is the pitch of the note.
A note should be turned on before it is turned off.
<LI> <b>DAMPER DOWN</b>: Depress the damper pedal.  The damper pedal on a piano makes sure that all
notes that are playing keep playing, regardless of whether they are turned OFF, until the damper
pedal is released.  
<LI> <b>DAMPER UP</b>: Release the damper pedal. 
</UL>
<p>
We are going to handle two representations of MIDI files.  You may read their 
specifications in the following links:
<p>
<OL>
<LI> <a href=CS302-Midi-Event-File-Spec.html>Event Files</a>: In these you specify events
in a linear stream, where each event contains the duration between it and the previous event.
<p>
<LI> <a href=CS302-Midi-Note-File-Spec.html>Note Files</a>: In these, you specify note events and
damper pedal events.  A note event is represented by a pitch, volume, start
time and stop time.  Thus, it stores two MIDI events -- an <b>ON</b> and an <b>OFF</b> event.
A damper pedal event is represented by a start and stop time.  Like a note, it stores two MIDI events --
a <b>DAMPER DOWN</b> and a <b>DAMPER UP</b> event.  
<p>
Unlike Event files, Note files are not a linear stream of events -- since each event has a start
and a stop time, events may be specified in any order.
</OL>
<p>
Again, read the specification files for more information and for simple example files that
illustrate their use.  You should go ahead and hand-edit some of these files and convert
them to MIDI to reinforce your understanding of MIDI.
<p>
The program <b>mconvert</b> converts Midi-Event Files to and from Midi-Note Files:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
mconvert inputfile outputfile E|N
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The <b>inputfile</b> can be either a Midi-Event-File or a Midi-Note-File.  The format
of the <b>outputfile</b> is either an Event file (if the last argument is <b>E</b>)
or a Note file (if the last argument is <b>N</b>).

<h2>cs302-midi.h</h2>

Take a look at
<b><a href=cs302-midi.h>cs302-midi.h</a></b>

</pre></td></table></center><p>

This defines a class called <b>CS302_Midi</b>, which lets you read, manipulate and
write both representations of Midi files.  The constructor takes a filename
and creates an instance of the class from the file.  The file can be in either
format (the first word in the file defines the format).  
There is a destructor method, which is necessary because the
constructor makes <b>new</b> calls.  Additionally, there is a 
<b>Write()</b> method, which writes out the class instance in either format.
<p>
There are two other public functions -- <b>Add_Pause()</b> adds a pause to the
file at the given start time and duration (both in seconds).
<b>Scale()</b> scales the speed of the file -- for example, scaling by 2 will
make it play twice as fast, and scaling by .5 will make it play half as fast.
<p>
There are four protected methods and two protected variables.  Let's start with
the variables:
<UL>
<LI> <b>el</b>:  This is a list of events as defined in a Midi-Event-File.  As you can see
from the <b>EventList</b> typedef, it is a list of pointers to <b>Event</b> class
instances.  When you create an instance of <b>CS302_Midi</b> from a Midi-Event-File,
it creates <b>el</b> directly from the file.  Each <b>Event</b> in the event list
is categorized by its <b>key</b>, which is <b>'O'</b> for an <b>ON</b> event, 
<b>'F'</b> for an <b>OFF</b> event, and <b>'D'</b> for either a <b>DAMPER DOWN</b>
or <b>DAMPER UP</b> event.  The <b>time</b> is the time (in 1/480 of a second) since
the previous event.  <b>v1</b> depends on the <b>key</b> -- if <b>key</b> is <b>'O'</b>
or <b>'F'</b>, then <b>v1</b> is the pitch.  Otherwise, it is 1 for <b>DAMPER DOWN</b>
and 0 for <b>DAMPER UP</b>.  <b>v2</b> is the volume of an <b>'O'</b> event.  It is
ignored for all other events.
<p>
<LI> <b>nd</b>:  This is a multimap of NOTE and DAMPER events as defined in a Midi-Note-File.
Each of these events has a start time, and the multimap is keyed on these start times.
Each multimap entry points to a <b>ND</b> class instance.  This contains all the information 
about the NOTE or DAMPER event.  
instances.  When you create an instance of <b>CS302_Midi</b> from a Midi-Note-File,
it creates <b>nd</b> directly from the file.  
<p>
Like an <b>Event</b>, a <b>ND</b> instance has a <b>key</b>, which is <b>'N'</b> for
a note and <b>'D'</b> for a damper pedal event.  The rest of the fields should be
self-explanatory.
</UL>
<p>
Two of the private methods are straightforward: <b>destroy_el()</b> deletes <b>el</b>, making
sure to delete every <b>Event</b> in the list.  <b>destroy_nd()</b> delete <b>nd</b>, 
making sure to delete every <b>ND</b> in the multimap.  These are called by the destructor,
and also by <b>Add_Pause()</b> and <b>Scale()</b>.
<p>
The last two methods are the tricky methods: <b>el_to_nd()</b> creates the multimap
<b>nd</b> from the event list <b>el</b>.  Conversely, <b>nd_to_el()</b> creates the 
event list <b>el</b> from the multimap <b>nd</b>.   These are called by the constructor --
if the constructor reads a Midi-Event-File, it creates <b>el</b> from the file and
then creates <b>nd</b> using <b>el_to_nd()</b>.  Conversely,
if the constructor reads a Midi-Note-File, it creates <b>nd</b> from the file and
then creates <b>el</b> using <b>nd_to_el()</b>.   
<p>
Thus, when the constructor is done, both <b>el</b> and <b>nd</b> are initialized to 
represent the same MIDI file.   This makes it easy to write <b>Write()</b> -- it 
uses <b>el</b> to create the Midi-Event-File output and it uses 
<b>nd</b> to create the Midi-Note-File output.

<h3>Your Job</h3>

The entire <b>CS302_Midi</b> class has been implemented for you, with the exception of
these last two methods.  Additionally, there are two programs
<b><a href=mconvert.cpp>mconvert.cpp</a></b> and 
<b><a href=midi_tester.cpp>midi_tester.cpp</a></b>, which test the implementation.
<p>
Your job is to implement the two unimplemented methods.  
<p>
The implementations that I provide for you are in 
<b><a href=cs302-midi-base.cpp>cs302-midi-base.cpp</a></b>.  The remaining two
methods are given a skeleton implementation in
<b><a href=cs302-midi.cpp>cs302-midi.cpp</a></b>.  This means that
you can copy them to your directory along with the <b>makefile</b> and they
will compile:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>make clean</b>
rm -f *.o midi_tester mconvert  core
UNIX> <b>make</b>
g++ -c midi_tester.cpp
g++ -c cs302-midi-base.cpp
g++ -c cs302-midi.cpp
g++ -o midi_tester midi_tester.o cs302-midi-base.o cs302-midi.o
g++ -c mconvert.cpp
g++ -o mconvert mconvert.o cs302-midi-base.o cs302-midi.o
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

First, let's consider <b>mconvert</b>.  This reads a file and then writes a file.
If we write a file of the same type, this version will work.  For example:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>mconvert C-Major-MEF.txt tmp.txt E</b>
UNIX> <b>cat tmp.txt</b>
CS302-Midi-Event-File
ON 0 60 64
ON 0 64 64
ON 0 67 64
OFF 480 60
OFF 0 64
OFF 0 67
UNIX> <b>mconvert C-Major-MNF.txt tmp.txt N</b>
UNIX> <b>cat tmp.txt</b>
CS302-Midi-Note-File
NOTE 60 64 0 1
NOTE 64 64 0 1
NOTE 67 64 0 1
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

The first call works because reading <b>C-Major-MEF.txt</b> reads all the events
into <b>el</b> in the constructor.  The constructor also calls <b>el_to_nd()</b>, 
but that doesn't do anything.  However, when we write the file with format <b>E</b>,
it write out <b>el</b>, which works fine.  
<p>
Similarly, when we read <b>C-Major-MNF.txt</b>, the constructor creates the <b>nd</b>
multimap.  It also calls <b>nd_to_el()</b>, but that doesn't do anything.  
When we print using format <b>N</b>, that traverses <b>nd</b> and 
prints out all the notes.  
<p>
If we try to read a MEF file and print it with format <b>N</b>, the resulting file
will be empty, because <b>el_to_nd()</b> has no implementation.  Similarly,
if we 
try to read a MNF file and print it with format <b>E</b>, the resulting file
will be empty:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>mconvert C-Major-MEF.txt tmp.txt N</b>
UNIX> <b>cat tmp.txt</b>
CS302-Midi-Note-File
UNIX> <b>mconvert C-Major-MNF.txt tmp.txt E</b>
UNIX> <b>cat tmp.txt</b>
CS302-Midi-Event-File
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

At this point, make sure you have understood everything.  Make sure you try the above
examples, and perhaps some others.  Read the implementation of the <b>Write()</b>
method and the constructor method so that you know how <b>el</b> and <b>nd</b> 
work.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>Your first implementation: nd_to_el()</h3>

First, implement <b>nd_to_el()</b>.  It is the easier of the two methods.  It should traverse
the <b>nd</b> multimap and create <b>ON/OFF/DAMPER DOWN/DAMPER UP/</b> events (of type <b>Event *</b>)
from them.  Think about how you should implement this.  You'll need
some temporary data structures.  You also need to worry about what
happens when multiple events occur at the same time.  For example,
look at <b><a href=Two-Repeat-MNF.txt>Two-Repeat-MNF.txt</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
CS302-Midi-Note-File
NOTE 60 65 0 1
NOTE 60 60 1 2
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The first note ends at time 1, and the second note begins at time 1.  You 
would not want this file to convert to the following MEF file:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
CS302-Midi-Event-File
ON 0 60 65
ON 480 60 60
OFF 0 60 
OFF 480 60 
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Why?  Because you would not have an OFF event corresponding to the first ON event until the note
is played a second time.  Instead, you want 
<b><a href=Two-Repeat-MNF.txt>Two-Repeat-MNF.txt</a></b> to convert to:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
CS302-Midi-Event-File
ON 0 60 65
OFF 480 60 
ON 0 60 60
OFF 480 60 
</pre></td></table></center><p>

So, here is what you should do in <b>nd_to_el()</b>:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Convert each <b>'N'</b> event into an <b>ON</b> and an <b>OFF</b> event.  Also
convert each <b>'D'</b> event into a <b>DAMPER DOWN</b> and a <b>DAMPER UP</b> event.  
<LI>
Insert each of these events into a temporary map keyed on the start time, which are
integers whose units are 1/480 of a second.  Use <b>rint()</b> to round the double to
an integer.
<p>
You are going to insert these events into a map and not a multimap.  
The val part of the map should be a multimap
containing all of the events that start at that time.  The events should be in the following
relative order:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> <b>OFF</b> events.
<LI> <b>DAMPER UP</b> events.
<LI> <b>DAMPER DOWN</b> events.
<LI> <b>ON</b> events.
</UL>
<p>
That way, notes will be turned off before they are turned on, and the damper pedal will be
set to up before it is set to down.
<p>
One final part of <b>nd_to_el()</b> -- if a <b>'N'</b> or <b>'D'</b> event is such that it
will start and stop at the same time once you convert them to integers, ignore the event.
For example, the following note should be ignored when you call <b>nd_to_el()</b> because
<b>rint(0.00000001*480.0) = rint((0.00000002*480.0) = 0</b>:

<pre>
NOTE 60 65 0.00000001 0.00000002
</pre>

<p>
<LI> Traverse the temporary map and push all the events onto <b>el()</b>, calculating the
correct time for each event.
</UL>
<hr>
<h3>Your second implementation: el_to_nd()</h3>

The method <b>el_to_nd()</b> is harder.  You are going to need a vector of 128 <b>(ND *)</b>'s.
Initialize them all to NULL.  Then, when you see an <b>ON</b> event, you will create a <b>ND</b> for
it, set its start time and put it into the vector, indexed by pitch.  
When you see an <b>OFF</b> event, you will 
use the <b>ND</b> in the vector, set its stop time, and insert it into <b>nd</b>.  
Similarly, you should have a <b>(ND *)</b> for the damper pedal, which you create when you 
encounter a <b>DAMPER DOWN</b> event, and which you finish and insert into the map with you 
encounter a <b>DAMPER UP</b> event.  At the end of traversing <b>el</b>, you should double-check
the vector and the damper variable and make sure that there are no notes that have <b>ON</b> events
that are not finished with corresponding <b>OFF</b> events.
<p>
There is some additional error checking that you should do.  I will not grade you on it.
However, you should be able to catch the following errors when you write <b>el_to_nd()</b>:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> An <b>OFF</b> event for a pitch that is not preceded by an <b>ON</b> event.
<LI> An <b>ON</b> event for a pitch that follows another <b>ON</b> event.
<LI> An <b>ON</b> event for a pitch that is never followed by an <b>OFF</b> event.
<LI> A <b>DAMPER UP</b> event that is not preceded by a <b>DAMPER DOWN</b> event.
<LI> A <b>DAMPER DOWN</b> event that follows another <b>DAMPER DOWN</b> event.
<LI> A <b>DAMPER DOWN</b> event that is never followed by a <b>DAMPER UP</b> event.
</UL>

<p>
When you are done with <b>el_to_nd()</b> and <b>nd_to_el()</b> the programs <b>mconvert</b> and
<b>midi_tester</b> should work with complete functionality.
<hr>
<h3>Files</h3>
There are working executables for <b>mconvert</b> and <b>midi_tester</b>, as well as a <b>cs302-midi.o</b>
that contains working implementations of <b>el_to_nd()</b> and <b>nd_to_el()</b>.  When it doubt,
make sure that your programs work like these.  Again, I will not grade you on how your programs 
error check, so don't stress about the output format.
<p>
Also, the gradescript makes use of two programs: <b>event-file-grader</b> and <b>note-file-grader</b>.
These take two Event and Note files respectively and print out if they differ.  The <b>note-file-grader</b>
ignores the order of note specifications in the input files -- it simply makes sure that both 
files have the same notes.
<p>
The <b>event-file-grader</b> is a little more detailed.  It partitions the events into "on" events 
(NOTE-ON and DAMPER DOWN) and "off" events (NOTE-OFF and DAMPER UP).  If events of the same type
occur simultaneously, then they may occur in any order.  For example, the following 
Midi-Event-Files are equivalent, although not identical, because:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td><pre>
DAMPER 5 DOWN
ON 0 60 65
ON 0 54 55

OFF 480 60 
OFF 0 54 
DAMPER 0 UP
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
ON 5 54 55
ON 0 60 65
DAMPER 0 DOWN

OFF 480 54 
DAMPER 0 UP
OFF 0 60 
</pre></td>
</table></center><p>
However, the following are not, since you can't reorder "on" and "off" events relative to each other, 
even though they happen at the "same time:"
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td><pre>
ON 0 60 65

DAMPER 5 DOWN
OFF 0 60

DAMPER 20 UP
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
ON 0 60 65

OFF 5 60
DAMPER 0 DOWN

DAMPER 20 UP
</pre></td>
</table></center><p>

<hr>
<h3>If you get inspired</h3>
If you get inspired to create some neat MIDI files, I'd love to see
them -- when you're done, feel free to email me MEF or MNF files that
you have created.  If I like them, I'll post them with the lab for
future years to see.
<hr>
<h3>A Final Word</h3>

I know that this is a brutal lab writeup.  It is long, and I'm
guessing it may take the entire lab session to read and understand.
This is part of computer science -- understanding specifications,
conventions, and formats, and working within those constraints.  Take
it slow, and try to understand the lab material piece by piece.  It
should be a rewarding lab!
